Description:=>

Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost at each step.


Steps:=>

Step1: Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.

Step2: Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree 
formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.  

Step3: Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

Time Complexity:=> O(ElogV)
